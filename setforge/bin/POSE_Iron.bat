:: This batch file allows you to create a training dataset from scratch. 
:: It creates rendered images at a random pose and stackes them with a background image. 
:: Follow the instructions. 
:: The result is a Python .pickle file with a dictionary containg the image data.
:: Note that the pickle file only contains
:: 
:: rgb images
:: normal maps
:: pose data (translation, quaterion)
:: stored in a dictionary as Xtr, Xtr_norm, Ytr_pose, Ytr_roi, Xte, Xte_norm, Yte_pose, Yte_roi

:: Note that the path to Python.exe needs to be set in PATH

:: FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
:: Note that batch does not tolerate spaces
:: Also, mind spaces behind the lines.

:: 1. Set the relative path to the 3D model as well as the distance between camera and model
SET model=../data/stanford_bunny_02_rot.obj
SET cam_distance=10

:: 2. Set the temporary data folder and the output folder
::  Also, set the final pickle filename and path
SET temp_folder="./bunnyx512_557"
SET output_folder="./bunnyx128_557"

SET final_pickle_path="../bunnyx64.pickle"

:: 3. Set the path to all background RGB images.
:: WRITE 'NONE' IF YOU DO NOT LIKE TO COMBINE THE RENERING WITH RANDOM BACKGROUND IMAGES 
SET bg_image_path="../data/sun_imgs"

:: 4. Set the image width and image height in pixel
set img_w=512
set img_h=512

:: change image size during the addition of background images
set im_w=128
set im_h=128

:: 5. Set the image width and height in pixels for the final pickle file
:: Note that this size can vary from the previous one, e.g., if you intend to reuse the images with a different resolution. 
:: (saves time)
set rows=64
set cols=64

:: 6. Set the camera path method. 
:: POLY for polyhedron image
:: POSE if a random pose should be selected. 
set method=POSE
set material=Fe
:: if set to 1, the object will only be rendered in its upright position. 
set upright=1

:: 6. Set the polyhedron sub-level. This will define the number of images to render
:: The higher the number, the more images. I tested to 6
set sublevel=6

:: 7. Set the number of rendered images you like to generate
set ren_num=100

:: 8. Set the boundaries for the object to be moved around in front of the camera.
:: The position of the model is selected by random within the given range. 
set limx=0.6
set limy=0.6
set near=2
set far=4

:: 9. Set the number of final images you like to generate
set num=100

:: 10. Activate noise by setting the variable to 1. 
set with_noise=1
set noise_dev=0.15

:: 11. Enable chromatic adaptation
set with_chromatic=0

:: 12. Set the percentage of images that should go into the cross-validation test file
:: as a percentage of num, in a range from [0,1] with 0->0%, 0.1-> 10%, 1.0 -> 100%
set x_test=0.1

:: THAT'S IT
