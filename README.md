# BRDF_imp
This project uses BRDF (Bi-directional reflection function) in "setforge" to create more realistic images for neural network training.
Setforge is a software developed by Dr. Rafael Radkowski to generate large number of traininig images of different modalities like RGB, Depth, normals and object masks
for neural network training. Each image in this dataset shows different position and rotation of the object we want to train.
This dataset can be used for semantic segmentation and pose estimation.
